# Virtual-File-System


#Technology: C
Description:

The Virtual File system provides all the functionality to the user which is same
as the UNIX based fle system.

It provides all necessary commands and system calls implementations of fle
system through customised shell.

Inode, Incore Inode Table, File Table, User File Descriptor Table etc.

platform
